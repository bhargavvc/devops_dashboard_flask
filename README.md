Below is an example of a “DevOps Dashboard Project” that ties together many of the tools mentioned. Keep in mind that in a production system each component would be more elaborate and reside in its own module or service. For this example, we’ll keep things as simple as possible while demonstrating how to:

- Build a **Flask dashboard** with a **Prometheus metrics endpoint**  
- Schedule background tasks with **schedule** and process webhook-triggered jobs with **RQ**  
- Run a basic **Scapy** packet sniffer (for demonstration)  
- Use **Docker SDK** and **Dagger** to build/manage containers  
- Create a CLI with **Typer** and enhance output with **Rich**  
- Deploy the application using a simple **Pulumi** program

Below is a breakdown of the project structure and code samples for each component.

## 1. Flask Dashboard and Prometheus Metrics

In **app.py** we create a simple Flask application that:

- Serves a dashboard (a simple HTML page)  
- Exposes a `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus scraping  
- Provides an endpoint `/webhook` to simulate an incoming event (which enqueues an RQ task)

```python
# app.py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, render_template_string
from prometheus_client import Counter, generate_latest, CONTENT_TYPE_LATEST
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue
import threading
import time

# Create a simple Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# Prometheus metric: count of processed webhook events
webhook_counter = Counter('webhook_events_total', 'Total number of webhook events processed')

# Setup Redis connection and RQ queue (assumes Redis is running on localhost:6379)
redis_conn = Redis()
task_queue = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

# Simple dashboard template
dashboard_template = """
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>DevOps Dashboard</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>DevOps Dashboard</h1>
    <p>Total webhook events processed: {{ counter }}</p>
    <p><a href="/metrics">View Prometheus Metrics</a></p>
</body>
</html>
"""

@app.route("/")
def index():
    # Render the dashboard with the current count from the metric
    return render_template_string(dashboard_template, counter=int(webhook_counter._value.get()))

@app.route("/metrics")
def metrics():
    # Expose Prometheus metrics
    return generate_latest(), 200, {'Content-Type': CONTENT_TYPE_LATEST}

@app.route("/webhook", methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    """
    Simulate receiving a webhook. Enqueue a background task.
    """
    data = request.get_json() or {}
    # Increment metric (in real world, do it in the worker after processing)
    webhook_counter.inc()
    # Enqueue a background job (the function is defined in tasks.py)
    from tasks import process_webhook
    task_queue.enqueue(process_webhook, data)
    return jsonify({"status": "enqueued", "data": data})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Start the Flask app in a thread so that we can also run scheduler tasks
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```

*Explanation:*  
- A Prometheus counter is incremented on each webhook call.  
- A POST to `/webhook` enqueues a background task with RQ.  
- The `/metrics` endpoint returns current metrics for Prometheus scraping.

---

## 2. Background Tasks: Scheduling and RQ

In **tasks.py** we define a task to process webhook data and also a scheduled task (using `schedule`) that runs periodically.

```python
# tasks.py
import time
import schedule

def process_webhook(data):
    """
    Process the incoming webhook data.
    (In a real project, this might trigger further processing.)
    """
    print("Processing webhook data:", data)
    # Simulate processing delay
    time.sleep(2)
    print("Finished processing webhook data.")

def scheduled_status_check():
    """
    A scheduled task that might check the status of an external API.
    For demonstration, we just print a message.
    """
    print("Scheduled status check: All systems operational.")

def run_scheduler():
    """
    Start the scheduler to run pending tasks.
    """
    # Schedule the status check every 30 seconds
    schedule.every(30).seconds.do(scheduled_status_check)
    while True:
        schedule.run_pending()
        time.sleep(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # For testing, you can run this file separately to see scheduler in action.
    run_scheduler()
```

*Explanation:*  
- `process_webhook` is the RQ task that gets enqueued when the webhook endpoint is called.  
- `scheduled_status_check` is a simple job scheduled to run every 30 seconds using the `schedule` library.  
- `run_scheduler` starts an infinite loop to run scheduled jobs.

*Note:* You can run the scheduler in a separate thread (or process) when running the app if needed.

---

## 3. Network Analysis Using Scapy

In **network.py** we include a very simple packet sniffer using Scapy. (This may require root/administrator privileges.)

```python
# network.py
from scapy.all import sniff

# Global statistics for demonstration
packet_stats = {"total_packets": 0}

def packet_callback(packet):
    packet_stats["total_packets"] += 1
    print(f"Packet #{packet_stats['total_packets']}: {packet.summary()}")

def start_packet_sniffer(timeout=20):
    """
    Start packet sniffing for a given timeout.
    """
    print("Starting packet sniffer...")
    sniff(prn=packet_callback, store=False, timeout=timeout)
    print("Packet sniffer stopped.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run the sniffer for 20 seconds for testing purposes.
    start_packet_sniffer()
```

*Explanation:*  
- `start_packet_sniffer` uses Scapy’s `sniff` function to capture packets for 20 seconds and prints a summary for each packet captured.

---

## 4. Containerization: Docker SDK and Dagger

In **docker_build.py** we demonstrate two things:  
1. Using the Docker SDK to list containers (or build an image)  
2. Using Dagger (async) to build a container image

> **Note:** Running these samples requires Docker to be installed and running. For Dagger, you need to have its engine accessible and the `dagger` Python package installed.

```python
# docker_build.py
import docker
import asyncio
import dagger

def list_containers():
    """
    List all running Docker containers using the Docker SDK.
    """
    client = docker.from_env()
    containers = client.containers.list()
    print("Running containers:")
    for container in containers:
        print(f"- {container.name} ({container.short_id})")

async def build_container_with_dagger():
    """
    Use Dagger to build a container image from a Dockerfile.
    This is a simplified example that pulls a base image and runs a command.
    """
    async with dagger.Connection() as client:
        container = (
            client.container()
            .from_("python:3.11-slim")
            .with_exec(["python", "-c", "print('Hello from Dagger-built container!')"])
        )
        output = await container.stdout()
        print("Dagger container output:", output)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # List containers using Docker SDK
    list_containers()
    
    # Run the Dagger build
    asyncio.run(build_container_with_dagger())
```

*Explanation:*  
- `list_containers` uses the Docker SDK to fetch and list running containers.  
- `build_container_with_dagger` demonstrates using Dagger to build a container that executes a simple Python command.

---

## 5. Command-Line Interface (CLI) with Typer and Rich

In **cli.py** we build a CLI that lets you run the web app, start the scheduler, trigger the network sniffer, and even run Docker operations. We use Typer for command parsing and Rich for enhanced logging.

```python
# cli.py
import typer
from rich.console import Console
import threading
import subprocess
import time
import asyncio

app_cli = typer.Typer()
console = Console()

@app_cli.command()
def run_server():
    """Start the Flask dashboard server."""
    console.print("[bold green]Starting Flask server...[/bold green]")
    # In a real deployment, you might use a WSGI server.
    subprocess.run(["python", "app.py"])

@app_cli.command()
def run_scheduler():
    """Start the background scheduler."""
    console.print("[bold blue]Starting scheduler...[/bold blue]")
    # Import and run the scheduler from tasks.py in a thread.
    from tasks import run_scheduler
    threading.Thread(target=run_scheduler, daemon=True).start()
    while True:
        time.sleep(1)

@app_cli.command()
def sniff():
    """Run the network packet sniffer."""
    console.print("[bold magenta]Starting packet sniffer...[/bold magenta]")
    subprocess.run(["python", "network.py"])

@app_cli.command()
def list_containers():
    """List Docker containers."""
    console.print("[bold cyan]Listing Docker containers...[/bold cyan]")
    subprocess.run(["python", "docker_build.py"])

@app_cli.command()
def dagger_build():
    """Build a container using Dagger."""
    console.print("[bold yellow]Building container with Dagger...[/bold yellow]")
    asyncio.run(__import__("docker_build").build_container_with_dagger())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app_cli()
```

*Explanation:*  
- This CLI uses Typer to expose commands such as `run-server`, `run-scheduler`, `sniff`, `list-containers`, and `dagger-build`.  
- Rich is used to colorize and style the output.  
- The commands run the corresponding Python scripts or functions.

---

## 6. Infrastructure as Code with Pulumi

Inside the **pulumi/** directory, create a simple Pulumi program that deploys a containerized app (for example, an AWS Lambda function using a container image).

**pulumi/Pulumi.yaml**  
```yaml
name: devops-dashboard
runtime: python
description: A Pulumi project to deploy the DevOps Dashboard as a container or Lambda.
```

**pulumi/__main__.py**  
Below is a simplified Pulumi program that deploys an AWS Lambda function using a container image. (This example assumes you have Pulumi configured with AWS credentials.)

```python
# pulumi/__main__.py
import pulumi
import pulumi_aws as aws
import pulumi_awsx as awsx

# Assume you have built a Docker image and pushed it to ECR.
# For this example, we simulate the image using awsx.ecr.Image.
repo = awsx.ecr.Repository("devops-dashboard-repo")

image = awsx.ecr.Image(
    "devops-dashboard-image",
    repository_url=repo.repository_url,
    context="..",          # context directory where Dockerfile is located
    dockerfile="Dockerfile",  # You should have a Dockerfile in your project root
    platform="linux/amd64"
)

# Create an IAM role for Lambda
lambda_role = aws.iam.Role("lambdaRole",
    assume_role_policy="""{
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [{
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Principal": {"Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com"},
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Sid": ""
        }]
    }"""
)

# Attach AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole policy
aws.iam.RolePolicyAttachment("lambdaRoleAttachment",
    role=lambda_role.name,
    policy_arn="arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole"
)

# Create a Lambda function using the container image
lambda_function = aws.lambda_.Function("devopsDashboardLambda",
    package_type="Image",
    image_uri=image.image_uri,
    role=lambda_role.arn,
    timeout=30,
    memory_size=512,
)

pulumi.export("lambda_function_name", lambda_function.name)
```

*Explanation:*  
- This Pulumi program creates an ECR repository, builds a container image (using the Docker context in your project), and deploys an AWS Lambda function based on that image.  
- You must have a `Dockerfile` in your project root for Pulumi to build the image.  
- In a real project, you might deploy a container service (ECS, Fargate) or even use Pulumi to configure other cloud resources.

---

## 7. Additional Notes

- **Security Scanning with Bandit:**  
  Although not part of the runtime code, you can run Bandit against your project with:
  ```bash
  bandit -r .
  ```
  This will scan your code for common security issues.

- **Running the Project:**  
  - Install dependencies listed in **requirements.txt** (which should include: `flask`, `prometheus_client`, `redis`, `rq`, `schedule`, `scapy`, `docker`, `dagger`, `typer`, `rich`, `pulumi`, `pulumi-aws`, `pulumi-awsx`).
  - Start the Flask app with `python app.py` or via the CLI:  
    ```bash
    python cli.py run-server
    ```
  - Start background tasks or other commands similarly via the CLI.

- **Docker and Dagger:**  
  Ensure Docker is installed and running. For Dagger, follow [Dagger’s installation instructions](https://dagger.io) to set up its engine.

- **Pulumi Deployment:**  
  Inside the `pulumi/` directory, run:
  ```bash
  pulumi up
  ```
  to deploy the infrastructure.

---

## Summary

This detailed project example demonstrates how you can integrate multiple DevOps tools in Python:

- A **Flask dashboard** provides a user interface and exposes **Prometheus metrics**.
- **Schedule** and **RQ** let you manage recurring tasks and event-triggered background processing.
- **Scapy** offers a simple way to sniff network packets.
- **Docker SDK** and **Dagger** help manage and build containerized applications.
- A **Typer/Rich CLI** provides a user-friendly command-line interface.
- **Pulumi** lets you deploy your solution as cloud infrastructure (e.g., an AWS Lambda function running a container).

While each snippet here is simplified, together they illustrate how different tools can interlink to form a complete DevOps solution.
